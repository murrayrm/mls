## UR5_Control
The Objective of the project is to use the UR5 robot to complete a Capital Alphabet Writing task using Rate Resolve control
- When the program starts, user is prompted by the program to “teach” the robot by manually moving the end effector (EE) and marker to the start and end points. These two points will determine the principle direction of writing and the start point
- By the hardcore curve and selected Alphabet, the UR5 arm will write them down in sequence
