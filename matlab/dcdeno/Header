     Richard,
     
     I have several files which comprise my matlab work for EE125 from 
     10/91.  Can I ftp them to an anonymous-writable location on avalon?  
     They contain CR-LF sequences since they began on a non-Unix system.
     
     I'll try to append them to this message.  Let me know if they arrive 
     intact.  We use Lotus' cc:Mail which facilitates attaching arbitrary 
     files to mail messages and lets you retrieve them en mass or 
     selectively.
     
     I looked in pub/murray/MLS and it reports
        .  unreadable      0 bytes
     I need to look at your chapter which deals withn tendon kinematics, 
     still.
     
     I have ordered from our library the two references you suggested.  
     Sorry to get on this late, but I took a medical license board exam in 
     Sept. and an intensive advanced cardiac life support course 2 weekends 
     ago.  Excuses...
     
     Hope all is well.  Fern and little Callie are fine.  Callie is now 
     holding herself up while she "stands", crawling, vocalizing complaints 
     when I'm slow to feed her, and wonderfully playful and affectionate.  
     I think I like the little pumpkin.
     
     Take care.  
     
     -- Curt
